# Handoff status

## Implemented

- Public repository scaffold and provider-neutral AI contributor instructions.
- Disabled synthetic target configuration, runtime shape validation and target/workspace selection.
- Executor and durable job interfaces (contracts only).
- Privacy candidate scanner with regression tests and GitHub CI definition.

## Not implemented

MCP runtime/SDK, actual file or command tools, SSH, durable storage, authentication, tunnels, CLI adapters, installer and service startup.

## Next work

Stage 1: introduce a pinned official SDK and lockfile, implement stdio handshake and one harmless tool, then workspace-scoped file operations and controlled local execution with tests.
Keep all real configuration outside the repository. Read AGENTS.md first.

## Validation

Local Node.js 24 validation: 7 tests passed; privacy candidate check passed for all staged source files. Remote CI results must be checked separately after push. No real device or client acceptance is claimed.
